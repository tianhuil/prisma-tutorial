# Dev Environment
Run postgres and raw prisma server `docker-compose up`
1. May need to run `docker-compose build` the first time.
2. May need to clean up previous runs with `docker-compose down -v`.

You may then:
- Access the raw prisma server at [http://localhost:4466/](http://localhost:4466/).
- Access the raw prisma server at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).
